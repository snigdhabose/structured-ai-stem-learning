# Structured AI-Assisted STEM Learning

This repository contains core resources and specifications for building structured, AI-integrated workflows in STEM educationâ€”specifically tailored for Excel 365. These tools are based on the Structured Constraint Satisfaction Problem (SCSP) framework and support debugging, formula generation, and structured assessment design.

## ðŸ“‚ Included Files

| File                         | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `Design_Recipe_Specification.xlsx` | Template for building and documenting Excel LAMBDA functions using the Design Recipe method. |
| `GEL_Specification_Doc.pdf`        | Full prompt and logic specification for the Generator of Exam Lambdas (GEL), which generates fill-in-the-blank Excel assessments. |
| `GEL_tests.xlsx`                  | Sample outputs and evaluation results from GEL, including accuracy and refinement metrics. |
| `HAD_Debugging.pdf`              | A detailed guide to Helper Array Debugging (HAD), including instrumentation templates, examples, and theory. |

## ðŸ“š Usage

These materials are designed for use in AI-assisted classrooms where students:
- Build complex formulas with Excel LAMBDA
- Practice with AI-generated exam problems using GEL
- Debug with structured outputs using HAD
- Document logic and test cases using Design Recipe templates
